Query: what are OVDs?
Response:     
Answer: OVDs (Officially Valid Documents) are the documents that are accepted by various regulated entities such as banks, financial institutions, and other entities as proof of identity and address for opening accounts, conducting transactions, and performing various financial activities. These documents are essential for ensuring customer due diligence and compliance with regulations to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.

As per the regulations issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other authorities, the list of OVDs includes but is not limited to:

1. Aadhaar Card issued by UIDAI
2. Passport
3. Voter's Identity Card
4. Driving License
5. PAN Card
6. NREGA Job Card
7. Letter issued by the National Population Register containing details of name and address
8. ID card issued to employees by the government and PSU
9. Documents issued by the Gazette Officer as proof of identity and address

Regulated entities are required to verify and maintain records of OVDs submitted by customers as part of their KYC (Know Your Customer) processes. It is crucial for these entities to ensure the authenticity and validity of the documents presented by customers to mitigate the risks associated with identity theft, fraud, and financial crimes.

Action items for regulated entities related to OVD compliance:

1. Regularly update the list of accepted OVDs based on RBI guidelines and notifications.
2. Implement robust customer due diligence processes to verify the authenticity of OVDs.
3. Conduct regular training and awareness programs for staff to recognize fake or forged documents.
4. Establish secure storage and retrieval mechanisms for maintaining records of OVDs.
5. Periodically review and audit OVD compliance procedures to identify and address any gaps or issues.
6. Immediately report any suspicious or fraudulent activities related to OVD usage to the relevant authorities.
7. Keep abreast of regulatory updates and changes in the list of acceptable OVDs to ensure ongoing compliance.

By following these action items, regulated entities can enhance their compliance with RBI regulations related to OVDs and strengthen their overall anti-money laundering and customer due diligence practices.
